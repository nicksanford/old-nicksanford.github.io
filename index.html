title: About Me
---

<p>My name is Nick Sanford. By day I build web apps and APIs in Ruby and Javascript.</p>
<p>By night I learn about Functional Programming, Haskell, and Elixir/Erlang.</p>
<p>I also eat lots of tapas, go to meetups, learn from people smarter than me, and enjoy the crazyness that is New York.</p>
