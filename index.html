title: About Me
---

<p>My name is Nick Sanford.</p>
<p> By day I build platform systems in Erlang.</p>
<p>By night I learn how to make flexable, dependable software that delights the people it touches.</p>
<p>I also eat lots of tapas, go to meetups, learn from people smarter than me, and enjoy the crazyness that is New York.</p>
